  <p class="lead">May 15, 2021</p>
  <p>Hoge Expansion Mint is finally finished with coding. There will be a 48 hour event scheduled in the coming days where Hoge Holders can use the mint to generatue a unique NFT. Contract address:
    <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x9894b5b1b1ab384cb23bbef6fecacbd994a95c76">https://etherscan.io/address/0x9894b5b1b1ab384cb23bbef6fecacbd994a95c76</a></p>
  <p>There will be a button to re-mint your original NFT from the Genesis collection on your url page. Example URL:
    <a href="https://www.hogemint.com/items/17">https://www.hogemint.com/items/17</a></p>
  <p>HogeMint uses NOWpayments to as a processor to deliver ETH to the address responsible for paying gas fees. Please double check any external links for <b>HTTPS</b> in the domain, and <b>https://nowpayments.io/payment/?XXXXXXXX</b> as the address.</p>

  <p>Currently all 328/328 original NFTs have been created and are registered on the blockchain. The address for the mint can be found here:
  <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x624f36C23b63F574565e9c60903ed765364566d1">https://etherscan.io/address/0x624f36C23b63F574565e9c60903ed765364566d1</a></p>
  <p>You may need to add the contract address to your assets to see the token: 0x624f36C23b63F574565e9c60903ed765364566d1</p>
  <p>The URIs all point back to the same 6 images, so although your token is non-fungible and unique, the URI is not. This was explained in the previous post</p>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p class="lead">Current Status:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration with CoinGate is complete, allowing you to pay your own gas fees. This feature will go live soon as the company is finalized.</li>
      <li>Rules for Generation 2 meme trading cards are being sorted out. This generation will be available to all wallet holders before the BigOne exchange listing goes live.</li>
      <li>Stay tuned for the 2nd generation of Hoge NFTs!!!</li>
    </ul>

<p>I've been trying like crazy to get all these NFTs minted but the gas cost ended up being $55/ea and there were 328 to print. You can do the math.</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p class="lead">Current State:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have minted 185/328 NFTs thus far.</li>
      <li>The NFT delivered to your wallet contains a URI (link) to one of 6 original images submitted by the community.</li>
      <li>This was a bug in the Solidity code where the wrong memory type was used for a local variable.</li>
      <li>Although your original image still exists, the NFT delivered most likely doesn't reference it.</li>
      <li>Sweet rare misprints!</li>
      <li>We want you to have your original image.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead">Future Roadmap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accept Hoge for Gas Fees => Mint your own NFT</li>
      <li>Requires deploying a new smart contract</li>
      <li>This new system will be Generation 2, The Reckoning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The error occured because every time the batchMint() function is called, new URIs are added to the array seen above,
    and the array persists after the function ends. Therefore the local variable i keeps referencing the first 5 or 6 images (thats how many I mint at a time because of gas fees),
    making the NFTs only ever refer to the first 5 or 6 made by the community. Whoops.</p>
